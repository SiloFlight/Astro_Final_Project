# About Project

This code sample was a self directed end of term project for my high school Astrophysics project.
The goal of this project was to determine whether using the Barnes-Hut algorithm to calculate the force of gravity on particles still accurately simulated gravity like  traditional Newtonian calculation.
The project uses Processing, a Java based IDE which comes with a prebuilt renderer.
